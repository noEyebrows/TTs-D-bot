# TTs-D-bot
WORK IN PROGRESS

DESCRIPTION:
Basic TTs Discord bot as long as you have right PIPs installed and follow instructions everythong works fine
The "-repeat" command is used for it to say what ever you want the bot to. ie: User: -repeat Hello Bot: Hello

NOTES:
-You dont at the time need to import everything in the code, since a few arent integrated yet

-The bot WILL NOT connect untill you follow the instructions @line 48

-Updates will be slow and code will be sloppy untill I have enough time to organize and debug everything
